#Git Lecture Notes

##Topics Discussed
* SSH, public key authentication.
* Version Control
* Git Basics
* Git Workflow
* Github
* Extra git commands
* Git GUI's

##SSH

###Installing ssh
`sudo apt-get install openssh-client`

###Connecting to server
`$ ssh username@hostname`

###Public key authentication
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`
The private key is at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` while the public key is at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
The server needs your public key to authenticate the connection.

##Version Control
* central VCS v/s Distributed VCS
* Why Version Control 
  - Helps remember history of project
  - Move back and forth in history
  - Any break in code can be fixed easily
  - Any bugs introduced can be traced back to the code that made it
* Examples : svn, cvs, mercurial, bzr, etc

##Git Basics
This is just a simple walkthrough. You are encouraged to try out these steps on your own.

- `git init` creates a new repository
- `git clone <url> [folder]`clones a repo from the server
- `git add <filename>` adds files to index
- `git add .` adds everything to index
- `git commit` creates a commit
- `git commit -a` adds all *modified* files to the index and starts a commit
- A blank commit message aborts the commit
- `git checkout <ref>` changes your working directory to a commit/tag/branch
- `git checkout -b branchname` creates a new branch and shifts to it
- `git branch` shows a list of all branches & the current branch
- `git branch <branch>` creates a new branch, but does not switch to it
- `git merge branchname` merges the branch with the current branch
- `git tag` marks a tag for the current commit

###A Little More
- `git pull [remote] [ref]` fetches and merges the branch/commit with the current HEAD
- `git fetch [remote] [ref]` fetches the commits for merging
- Therefore, `pull` = `fetch` + `merge`
- Similarly, `checkout -b` = `branch` + `checkout` //Create and checkout 

##Little of git-jargon
Read more over [here](http://book.git-scm.com/7_glossary.html)

- `branch` is an active line of development.
- `commit` is a snapshot of the working directory
- `tag` is an alias of a particular commit
- `HEAD` is a pointer to the current checked out branch
- `tree` is the internal representation of working directory in git
- `blob` is the internal representation of files in git
- `index` is a staging area for the commit in progress

##Git Workflow

###Fork, Merge, Pull
This is what Github follows. People create their own fork version of the repo, and send back pull requests

###Shared Repository
A single repository shared among various people can be used successfully if the project is closed, and has known developers
This is mainly for [organizations](github.com/sdslabs) and trusted developers

###Branching Model
Mainly from [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)  
Topics include branches, stable, hotfix, release, development, feature branch etc.

##Github
- <http://github.com> is an awesome site that allows people to share code, projects and colloborate easily using git.
- Create an account
- Setting up ssh-keys
- Creating repository
- Setting `remotes`
- `push`, `pull`, `fetch`, `merge`
- [Github gem](https://github.com/defunkt/github-gem)
- Online Editing as well (press `e` on a file)

##Some other things

A few more git commands

- `git log` allows you to see your history
- `git log --oneline` gives single line history
- `git log --pretty` gives better output
- `git log --graph` shows your commit graph
- Git GUI Systems - `gitg`, `git-cola`, `qgit`, `giggle` and the windows git-gui as 
- Mac - [Gitbox](http://gitboxapp.com/), [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- `.gitignore` file to store system specific stuff (configuration, databases, temp files, cache, build)
- `tig` is an awesome commit browser that runs on the command line.

To install any of the packages mentioned above, just run `sudo apt-get install package` in ubuntu.

##Redmine
- Create user accounts (Registration)
- `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` should be setup
- Pass along the public keys (via email)

##Commit Messages Editing
When you make commits on git, it uses your default text editors to type the commit message. This is set to `vim` in Windows and Linux. Linux folks can change it to anything else by setting the $EDITOR variable by the following command:
`export EDITOR=nano` (Replace nano with the editor of your choice like gedit geany etc)

You can also save the setting in your git global configuration, by :
`git config --global core.editor "nano"`

As per [this question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10564/how-can-i-set-up-an-editor-to-work-with-git-on-windows), you can use Notepad++, or notepad etc on git on Windows as well.

`git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"` 

Take care about the slashes, and the path to your editor of choice. Don't use notepad, it screws with the newlines.

###Vim
If you're stuck with vim for some reason, do the following in the commit window

1. Press `i` to go to insert mode
2. Type your commit message
3. Press `Esc`
4. Type `:wq`. The colon is important
5. Press `Enter`
6. That's it, your commit should be successful

Remember, an empty commit message aborts the commit. Also the best way to commit easily is:

`git commit -m "Commit Message Here"` to just type the commit message on the command line, and leave out all the hassle of the editor

To learn how to use vim effectively, type 'vimtutor' in terminal.

##Faster Git Resources

Git allows you to defined aliases for certain commands. These faster ways of using git create several additional commands for git, such as `git release`, and `ga` etc

- [Git Aligned Logs](http://pyrtsa.posterous.com/aligning-your-git-logs)
- [Git-Number](https://github.com/holygeek/git-number) - Similar to SCM Breeze

Also see `tig`, which is a cli repo browser for git.
